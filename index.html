            <h3>SKILLS</h3>
            <hr>
            <p style="color: #EFE9D5;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can confidently say that I possess more than five distinct skills, each contributing to my personal development and leisure. One of the skills I’m most proud of is my ability to cook, which not only serves as a practical skill but also as a creative outlet. I enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and cuisines, constantly refining my techniques and learning new recipes. Cooking has become a way for me to unwind after a long day, and I find great satisfaction in preparing a meal from scratch.

                Another skill I’ve mastered over the years is solving a Rubik’s Cube. While many find it daunting, I’ve learned the algorithms and patterns required to solve it quickly. This skill has taught me patience, problem-solving, and perseverance, as there were many failed attempts before I could solve the puzzle consistently. It’s a fun mental challenge that I can pick up whenever I want to exercise my mind.
                
                Riding a motorcycle is also an activity that I enjoy immensely. There’s something about the feeling of freedom on the open road, the wind in my face, and the hum of the engine beneath me. It’s a skill that requires focus and coordination, but the thrill of riding makes it all worth it. I’ve spent a considerable amount of time learning the ins and outs of motorcycle handling, and it has become an essential part of my life.
                
                Driving a car, on the other hand, is a more practical skill I use daily. From navigating busy city streets to going on road trips, driving offers me independence and flexibility. I’ve always enjoyed being behind the wheel, and the freedom it provides is something I never take for granted. It’s also a skill that requires constant attention and adjustment, especially in different weather conditions or traffic situations.
                
                In addition to these skills, I’m also a consistent shooter when it comes to basketball. While I may not be a professional, I’ve honed my shooting ability over the years, practicing regularly to improve my accuracy and range. The satisfaction of sinking a perfect shot is something I can never tire of. Basketball has also taught me the importance of teamwork and discipline, both on and off the court.
                
                Finally, I have the ability to run out 10 balls in billiards, which is something I’m quite proud of. It’s a skill that requires focus, precision, and strategy. Running out balls in billiards is no easy feat, and it has taken countless hours of practice to master. The mental game involved in planning each shot and the physical execution of it is something that I truly enjoy.
                
                These skills may seem like hobbies or pastimes, but they’ve become an integral part of my daily life. They keep me active, both mentally and physically, and provide me with a sense of accomplishment. Whether I’m cooking a new dish, solving a Rubik’s Cube, or sinking a perfect shot in basketball, these activities add excitement and fulfillment to my routine. They allow me to explore different facets of myself and continue to grow, all while having fun. Life wouldn’t be the same without these skills, as they bring balance and joy to my everyday experiences.

            <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>My hobbies are quite similar to what many others enjoy, but they hold a special place in my life. One of my favorites is playing basketball, a sport that I can never get tired of, no matter how often I play. I love the adrenaline that comes with each game, the sound of the ball bouncing on the court, and the challenge of improving my skills. Even if I play every day, I never feel bored because there’s always something new to work on, whether it’s refining my dribbling, improving my shooting technique, or enhancing my defense.

                Basketball isn’t just about the physical activity; it’s also about strategy and teamwork. I enjoy playing with friends and teammates, working together to outsmart the opposing team and score points. The camaraderie that comes with playing a team sport is unmatched, and I’ve learned so much about cooperation and communication on the court. Every time I sink a basket, especially a difficult shot, it’s a small victory that makes me feel accomplished.
                
                Another hobby that I’ve become quite passionate about is playing billiards. I’ve always enjoyed the game because it’s a great mix of skill, precision, and mental focus. Over time, I’ve developed a knack for the game, and I’m proud of my ability to run out a whole rack. The satisfaction of clearing the table in one go is hard to describe, but it’s a feeling of mastery that keeps me coming back for more.
                
                Billiards, for me, is not just about sinking balls into pockets; it’s about strategy and anticipation. I love planning out my shots, thinking two or three steps ahead, and executing them with accuracy. It’s a game that requires patience and practice, and I’ve spent many hours honing my skills. The beauty of billiards lies in the mental challenge it presents, as every game forces me to think critically and adjust my approach.
                
                Even though both basketball and billiards might seem like typical hobbies, they bring a lot of value to my life. They allow me to escape from daily stress, providing an outlet for my energy and focus. Whether I’m shooting hoops or lining up my next shot at the pool table, these activities give me a sense of purpose and enjoyment. They are more than just pastimes; they’re ways for me to challenge myself, relax, and have fun with others.
                
                In addition, both sports have taught me valuable life lessons. Basketball has shown me the importance of perseverance and how to handle both success and failure gracefully. I’ve learned that practice is essential to getting better, and it’s the same with billiards. Every miss and every mistake is an opportunity to learn and improve. Both hobbies have pushed me to be more disciplined and focused, which has positively impacted other areas of my life as well.
                
                Despite how common these hobbies may seem, they provide me with a sense of fulfillment that’s hard to find elsewhere. Whether I’m playing basketball with friends or taking on a challenging billiard game, they make my life richer and more enjoyable. The consistency of these hobbies, especially when I engage in them every day, helps to keep me grounded and active. I feel like I’ve developed a unique connection with both sports, and they’ve become integral parts of my routine.

            <h3>INTEREST</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>I’ve always had a deep interest in understanding how things work, especially when it comes to technology and design. The process of how devices like smartwatches and smartphones are created fascinates me. From the concept phase to the final product, there are so many intricate details that go into making these gadgets functional and stylish. I’m particularly intrigued by the combination of hardware and software in devices like smartphones, where everything from the processor to the user interface works together seamlessly. It’s amazing to think about how these tiny components are assembled to create something so powerful and versatile.

                The same curiosity applies to everyday objects, like basketballs. I often find myself wondering how the materials are selected, how the ball is inflated, and how its design affects its performance on the court. Even the way the seams are stitched and the grip is formed plays a role in how it feels when you shoot, dribble, or pass. Understanding the thought and technology behind these items gives me a greater appreciation for them, and I find it exciting to learn more about the processes behind their creation.
                
                Along with my interest in technology and design, I’ve developed a fascination with tattoos. Tattoos are not just artwork; they are personal stories and expressions of identity. What I find so intriguing is the power of a tattoo to carry meaning, whether it’s a symbol of an important event, a representation of one’s culture, or simply a design that holds personal significance. The idea that a design can be chosen and permanently inked on the skin adds another layer of depth to its meaning.
                
                Tattoos also reflect a sense of individuality. People can pick any design they want, and it becomes a part of who they are, etched permanently into their bodies. Each tattoo is unique, as no two people are likely to have the exact same design or placement. I find the process of choosing a tattoo deeply personal, as it involves reflecting on what is meaningful to you. Whether it’s a tribute to loved ones, a reminder of personal growth, or simply something that brings joy, tattoos have the ability to tell a lifelong story.
                
                The artistry behind tattoos is another aspect that fascinates me. The level of skill required by tattoo artists to transform a design into a beautiful, permanent piece of art on skin is impressive. It’s amazing to see how detailed and precise some tattoos can be, with shading, colors, and patterns that make each piece stand out. I’ve often wondered how tattoo artists perfect their craft and how they decide on the techniques and styles that work best for each design.
                
                What’s even more remarkable is that tattoos are timeless. Unlike many things in life, a tattoo doesn’t fade away with time—it becomes a part of you. Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate how tattoos reflect personal journeys, memories, and milestones. A tattoo can represent a moment in your life that stays with you forever, no matter where you go or what changes occur. It’s a form of self-expression that has lasting significance, and that permanence is something I find truly fascinating.
                
                These interests—whether it's understanding how gadgets are made, learning about the craftsmanship of basketballs, or exploring the world of tattoos—allow me to delve deeper into the creativity and craftsmanship that shapes our world. They remind me that everything we use or experience has a story, and often, the processes behind their creation are far more intricate and fascinating than we might initially realize.
